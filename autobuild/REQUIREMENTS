host and usernames can be found from autobuild.sh (they are actually
configurable, but this has not been tested)

a (private) ssh key is used to access the buildhost, it must be
authorized for both the autobuild user and root. The local location is
configurable (as before)

On the buildhost the build user needs sudo access to root without password and
required tty in order to run rpm and yum commands

#
# Disable "ssh hostname sudo <cmd>", because it will show the password in clear.
#         You have to run "ssh -t hostname sudo <cmd>".

Defaults    requiretty
Defaults:abuild !requiretty     #last match used
