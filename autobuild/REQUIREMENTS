1.) ssh requirements

host and usernames can be found from autobuild.sh (they are actually
configurable, but this has not been tested)

a (private) ssh key is used to access the buildhost, it's public
counterpart must be authorized for the autobuild user. The local
location is configurable (as before)

Historical note: In some phase we also required ssh access to root@buildhost.
This has been replaced by sudo as below, because 

1.) it makes use of the existing setup-buildenv.sh easier
2.) we don't need to copy the private key to the build host (e.g.
    if we modified setup@buildenv.sh to do a ssh root@localhost in case
    there is no tty)


2.) sudo requirements
 
On the buildhost the build user needs sudo access to root without password and
required tty in order to run rpm and yum commands

#
# Disable "ssh hostname sudo <cmd>", because it will show the password in clear.
#         You have to run "ssh -t hostname sudo <cmd>".
#
Defaults    requiretty
Defaults:abuild !requiretty     #last match used

...

abuild  ALL=(root)   NOPASSWD: /bin/cp, /usr/bin/yum

3.) http proxy

It might be useful to use a local http proxy, because a lot of packages
are downloaded from the net repeatedly.

For wget the proxy can be set in /etc/environment like this

http_proxy=http://192.168.56.68:80


yum doens't seem to obey this environment variable, it needs its own
configuration in /etc/yum.conf like this

proxy=http://192.168.56.68:80


Note: Apache disk cache file size is limited to 1 MB by default.
      http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_disk_cache.html

      E.g. Solr source tar ball is about 70 MB, so I changed the limit to
      100 MB like this

      CacheMaxFileSize 100000000
