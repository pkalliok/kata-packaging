autobuild is carried out in 3 phases

Phase 1: installing the development KATA system

Phase 2: packaging the development KATA system (i.e. builing prod.rpm)
         and transferring all 3 rpms to the control host

Phase 3: installing the production system


Phase 1 + 2 are carried out on the development host. The phases have been
separated because after phase 1 we have a fully functional KATA system.
It might be useful to do some (smoke) testing between these phases. (Once
we have that fully automated the phases can be combined.)

Phase 3 is carried out on the production host. There are 2 choices:
Either the VM used as development machine before is reset and used
again or there is a dedicated production host. Because we haven't
scripted VMs yet, this needs to be a separate phase.

The phase is given as a numeric argument to the autobuild script

$ autobuild/autobuild.sh [1|2|3]
