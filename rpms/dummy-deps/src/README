This package provides dummy dependencies for Kata. In other words it
claims to provide some packages, which we do not need, but which other
packages depend on. man.rpm is the classic example. It is not needed
on the production server (in fact indexing cronjob disturbs) but it is
pulled in via some dependencies.
