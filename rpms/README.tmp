How to clean up after uninistallation of kata-prod 

(TODO: This should be all handled by our scriptlets when uninstalling
or upgrading our packages, so eventually this file should be empty)


0. Introduction

Note: we are just switching from using rpm -i to yum install.
If yum remove does not work, use rpm -e.  

a.)  No changes have happened in apache-solr, so this pacakge does not even
to be uninstalled.

b.) mcfg has no scriptlets, so it can be uninstalled using 

$ sudo yum remove mcfg

and everything should be fine.


c.) kata-prod is uninstalled using command

$ sudo yum remove kata-prod

but this needs clean-up as described in the rest of this document.
