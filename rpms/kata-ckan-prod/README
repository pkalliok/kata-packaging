1. For reproducible results it is recommended to start always in a
   fresh CentOS installation. Setup a user account for building
   (building as root is generally not a good idea) and add it to
   sudoers. Myself I use an LVM-based snapshot to be able to reuse the
   same prepared virtual machine quickly.

2. Install kata-ckan-dev-rpm (see ../kata-ckan-dev/README for hints)

3. run ../setup-buildenv
