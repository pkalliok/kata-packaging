if you set up your rpmbuild environment under ~/rpmbuild
like suggested in http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SetupRpmBuildEnvironment
you can call the script build-from-repo.sh from this directory

In case you want/need to call rpmbuild manually just make sure that AUTOV
environment variable is set to some reasonable version number
