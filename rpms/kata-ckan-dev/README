1. Building

Requirements: Building has been tested in a plain minimal CentOS 6.2
installation. For my own adminstration I had already installed

- openssh-client
- make & git (they are needed by etckeeper, which I install from source)

Not sure whether any of those is really needed.

For building I install 2 packages

- rpm-build
- redhat-rpm-config

(not sure whether the latter one is needed)

If you set up your rpmbuild environment under ~/rpmbuild
like suggested in http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SetupRpmBuildEnvironment
you can call the script build-from-repo.sh from this directory

These steps have also been automated in ../setup-buildenv.sh

In case you want/need to call rpmbuild manually just make sure that AUTOV
environment variable is set to some reasonable version number


2. Installation

In a plain mininal operating system installation running rpm -i will fail
because of missing dependencies. These can be installed using a single command
line as follows:

$ sudo rpm -i kata-ckan-dev-305045-1.el6.i686.rpm 2>&1 | grep "is needed" | cut -c 2- | cut -f 1 -d " " | sudo xargs yum install -y


3. Administration

Check whether the CKAN server is running

$ sudo service ckan-dev status

Stop the server

$ sudo service ckan-dev stop

Start the server

$ sudo service ckan-dev start


4. Development features during installation

If files /tmp/kata-SKIP01 or /tmp/kata-SKIP02 exist Python packages are
not installed (useful for quick testing of other scripts, installing
Python packages takes quite long)

01 = installing virtualenv and creating pyenv
02 = installing CKAN and dependencies into pyenv
