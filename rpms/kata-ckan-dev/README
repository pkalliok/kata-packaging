1. Building

If you set up your rpmbuild environment under ~/rpmbuild
like suggested in http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SetupRpmBuildEnvironment
you can call the script build-from-repo.sh from this directory

In case you want/need to call rpmbuild manually just make sure that AUTOV
environment variable is set to some reasonable version number

2. Installation

If environment variable SKIP01 or SKIP02 is set Python packages are
not installed (useful for quick testing of other scripts, installing
Python packages takes quite long)

01 = installing virtualenv and creating pyenv
02 = installing CKAN and dependencies into pyenv
