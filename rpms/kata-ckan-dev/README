1. Building

If you set up your rpmbuild environment under ~/rpmbuild
like suggested in http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SetupRpmBuildEnvironment
you can call the script build-from-repo.sh from this directory

In case you want/need to call rpmbuild manually just make sure that AUTOV
environment variable is set to some reasonable version number

2. Installation

In a plain mininal operating system installation running rpm -i will fail
because of missing dependencies. These can be installed using a single command
line as follows:

$ sudo rpm -i kata-ckan-dev-305045-1.el6.i686.rpm 2>&1 | grep "is needed" | cut -c 2- | cut -f 1 -d " " | sudo xargs yum install -y

3. Development features during installation

If files /tmp/kata-SKIP01 or /tmp/kata-SKIP02 exist Python packages are
not installed (useful for quick testing of other scripts, installing
Python packages takes quite long)

01 = installing virtualenv and creating pyenv
02 = installing CKAN and dependencies into pyenv
