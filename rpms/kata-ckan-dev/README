if you set up your rpmbuild environment under ~/rpmbuild
like suggested in http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SetupRpmBuildEnvironment
create 3 symbolic links to use this source (currently we use plain files,
which is not standard packaging, but nice for development work)

here=$(pwd)
cd ~/rpmbuild
ln -s ${here}/kata-ckan-dev.spec SPECS/
#ln -s ${here}/kata-ckan-dev-0.1.tgz SOURCES/
ln -s ${here}/01getpyenv.sh SOURCES/
ln -s ${here}/80backuphome.sh SOURCES/
