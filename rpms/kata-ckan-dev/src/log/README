log of the first successful installation saved here (i386) (SHA-1 unknown)

just in case we get problems with reproducability sometimes in the future
when some of the download locations change

pip.freeze of that installation was not saved.

The saved pip.freeze is older, from the first manual installation. It
still contains e.g. celery and amqplib dpendencies, which were removed
a couple of days later.
