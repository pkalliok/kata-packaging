Upgrading kata-ckan-prod

0.) Introduction

The installation of kata-ckan-prod.rpm is mainly intended for installation on
a clean minimal RHEL/CentOS system as documented in INSTALL. Upgrading an
existing installation is only supported by carefully following the
instructions below.

No changes have happened in apache-solr, so this package does not
need to be uninstalled, upgraded or reinstalled.


1.) Clear the search index

TODO: currently unclear whether we need this step. There might be
      still changes coming to index updating during production and
      they will have an influence what needs to be done for upgrade.

$ sudo service supervisord stop
$ sudo service rabbitmq-server stop
   (Above commands ensure that harvesters don't fetch anything new during 
   cleaning. Uninstallation of kata-ckan-prod does it, too, but
   after uninstallation we cannot run it)

$ sudo -s -u ckan
$ cd
$ source pyenv/bin/active
$ cd pyenv/src/ckan
$ paster --plugin=ckan search-index clear --config=development.ini
$ exit                               (exit from previous sudo)

TODO: if we really need this step, above commands should be added
to our existing paster script.


2.) uninstall kata-ckan-prod and mcfg

$ sudo yum remove mcfg           (this will pull kata-ckan-prod with it)


3.) Clean-up of Postgres

$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/pgsql/data/


4.) Uninstallation of supervisor

(the idea is to get rid of the configuration modified by kata-prod, so we can 
start with a fresh one again)
 
$ sudo yum remove supervisor
$ sudo rm /etc/supervisord.conf.rpmsave

(The rm commands here and in the following steps are only for your
orientation. The idea is to make sure that now configuration of the
package in question should remain. If etckeeper is in use
the appropriate "git rm" commands should be given instead)


5.) Uninstallation of shibboleth

(same idea as with supervisor)

$ sudo yum remove shibboleth
$ sudo rm -r /etc/shibboleth


6.) Uninstallation of apache

(same idea as with supervisor)

$ sudo yum remove httpd
$ sudo rm -r /etc/httpd


7.) Clean-up rabbitmq

$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/rabbitmq/* 

TODO: It appears that rabbitmq will recreate this
properly when started again. If there are problems it might be
necessary to uninstall the package. (If there are severe problems
older versions of this document contain more debugging info, but currently
I assume that is not needed)


8.) Install the new packages

Follow the steps 

- install master configuration tool and
- install KATA

in the INSTALL document.
