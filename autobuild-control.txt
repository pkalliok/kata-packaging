Autobuild has 2 main levels

1. The snapshot & virtualization levels

This is an open question. Aleksi uses ZFS & KVM, but Nomovok server
uses Xen. ZFS we don't know, but maybe not. So maybe we can
postpone this for the moment.

2. The build control

Build control is the system that controls the overall build cycle.
These are the follwing steps

1. in VM dev1: get newest source code from git and build
2. reset VM dev2
3. transfer dev.rpm from VM dev1 to VM dev2
4. in VM dev2: install dev.rpm
5. in VM dev2: get newest source and build prod.rpm
6. reset VM prod
7. transfer prod.rpm to  


I don't think anybody has this at
