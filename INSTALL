Footnotes

[1] If you don't want to type the names of the missing dependencies you
can use a pipe like this. (For advanced system admins, you are running
"automatic" commands read in from a pipe as root!)

sudo rpm -i package-being-tried.rpm 2>&1 | grep "is needed" | grep -v -F ".so" | cut -c 2- | cut -f 1 -d " " | sudo xargs yum install -y

TODO: check the pipe, especially the 2nd grep statement has been typed here
without testing in real life.
