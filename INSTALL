Installation for kata administrators

Installation should be carried out on a clean RHEL 6 / CentOS 6 machine


I. Packages delivered:

1. mcfg.rpm  (called the master configuration tool)
2. apache-solr.rpm
3. kata-prod.rpm
4. dummy-deps.rpm

(rpm files will have version numbers in their names, these have been left
out in this document for the sake of simplicity. Of course you need to
specify complete file names including version numbers in all commands
given below.)


II. Installation steps

1. Enable EPEL & Shibboleth repos
   1.a. "sudo yum install http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-7.noarch.rpm"
   1.b "cd /etc/yum.repos.d"
   1.c "sudo curl -O http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security://shibboleth/CentOS_CentOS-6/security:shibboleth.repo"


2. Install dummy-deps

   (This package helps to avoid having packages installed which are not
   required on a production server)

   "sudo yum install dummy-deps.rpm"

3. Install Apache solr

   3.a. "sudo yum install apache-solr.rpm"


4. Install master configuration tool

   4.a. "sudo yum install mcfg.rpm"
   4.b. copy the provided master configuration sample file
        "sudo cp -i /usr/share/mcfg/examples/kata-master.ini /root/"
   4.c. Edit it "sudo -e /root/kata-master.ini"
        Cf. Appendix A configuration for details


5. Install kata

   4.a. "sudo yum install kata.rpm"

6. Use kata

   System is operational. All configuration has happened in step 4.c.


A. Configuration

A.1. SSL keys and certificates

   Apache and Shibboleth need an SSL key and certificate pair. It's possible
   the use the same pair for both programs or have a different pair for each
   program.

   The configuration is slightly different for the two programs. The
   key/certificate pair for Shibboleth will be installed by mcfg. The
   administrator provides the input filenames in the following two
   parameters in /root/kata-master.ini (Installation means the files are
   copied to /etc/shibboleth as spcert.pem and spkey.pem. After installation
   the input files could be deleted.)

[shibboleth-sp-cert]
location: /root/sp-cert.pem

[shibboleth-sp-key]
location: /root/sp-key.pem

   The filenames should be given as absolute paths, the names do not matter.

   For Apache the key/certificate pair is not installed by mcfg, but the file
   names of a previously installed pair are given in the following 2
   parameters

[DEFAULT]
apache_ssl_cert: /etc/shibboleth/spcert.pem
apache_ssl_key: /etc/shibboleth/spkey.pem

   The default values shown here refer to the Shibboleth key/certificate pair.
   If they remain unchanged Apache will use the same certificates that
   are being installed for Shibboleth as previously described.
